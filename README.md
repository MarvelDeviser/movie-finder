# movie-finder
Movie Finder shows you suggestions of movies, TV series, or TV shows based on the words that you searched.

To build this application I setted up the server using Node.js and Express. The views are generated using Embedded JavaScript (EJS), and the concept of partials to "DRY" the code (Don't Repeat Yourself). I used the npm package 'request' to do the API request, and the API that serves the movies data is the Omdb.

All the technology used on this application is scalable and very reliable. Moreover, I think one really nice thing is that Bootstrap allowed me to develop this responsive app without writing a single line of CSS!
